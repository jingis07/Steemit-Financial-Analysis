Looking at the graph we see the market cap of STEEM  dropping from January to March, so what does this mean for the STEEM crypto currency?

Market cap is the total value of all the coins. Market Capitalization is simply the amount of Money (USD, EUR, GBP NGN etc) invested into a cryptocurrency. As the market cap number increases the value of the cryptocurrency increases which means it is gaining more popularity. Market Capitalization is what determines the value of a coin.

If the supply of a coin is very high then it means there are so many coins  and it could mean many things and one of them is that might it is cheap or that each one is not worth very much. Or if the price of an individual coin is high but the market cap is low it probably means that there are not many coins.

At the end of Mach 2018 Steem had a market cap of about 397,763,107.68 from a January high of about 2,015,799,445.07

Market Cap = Price x Circulating Supply

Volume is the total number of crypto currency thatâ€™s been traded in the last 24 hours period.
If the volume is more then it means then the coin is active and more people started to show interest in buying and selling.

Volume is important as it tells us how active the coin is. If volume is high it means many people are interested in buying or selling it and vice versa. Volue remaining high is good because it could mean that the coin is very active so it will be easy to buy and sell.

Monthly Trasactions (trasnfers) gives us a peep into how users on steemit move their STEEM AND SBD. Most of the top transfers were to exchanges.

Transfers to bid bots is also increasing as people look to earn more from their post

The transfers to other users consisted of 'small' transfers but still constituted a large percentage of total transfers

Powering up - If you have STEEM tokens, you can Power Up to STEEM Power to get more voting influence on posts and comments.

Powering down -means converting your STEEM Power into liquid STEEM over a period of time. It takes about 12 weeks to convert your steem power to steem. You will lose your influence in the network proportionally to how much is powered down.

CONCLUSION

On market cap, supply and price

The market cap of STEEM has taken a slight  from January to March and we can see the relationship between market cap and price. As market cap is dropping, the price of steem is also dropping.

In the last few months government around the world are cracking down crypto currencies and bringing new regulations which has affected the confidence in cryto currencies, people are beginning to doubt its sustainability

Power-UP and Power-DOWN should be able to find a balance, looking at the graphs we can see a lot of power down as the price of steem was dropping, that was a 'panic' from most users who wanted to 'cash out' in fear of the collapse of steem price.

Too much powering down is not good for the system, the difference between power up and down should not be much.

The financial future of steemit and steem is very bright and can only get better
